# VAELEN Roadmap

STATUS: VALIDATED for the Phase 00 status it reports (checked against the code and test
runs of 2026-09-05 on branch `claude/vaelen-master-prompt-aw7zqj`); everything from
Phase 01 onwards is PLANNED and does not exist in the repository.

World: AELVOR. Slogan: "NOTHING IS GIVEN. EVERYTHING IS INHERITED." Secondary: "HISTORY
BELONGS TO NO ONE." The player starts as an enslaved person in a huge autonomous mining
colony. No chosen one, no main quest, no canonical ending.

The master prompt is the authority for the phase list and its objectives; the objective
lines below paraphrase it in one sentence each. Work follows the protocol
PLAN -> EXPLAIN -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> VALIDATE -> NEXT, and every progress report shows
the BUILD STATUS block (`Docs/CONVENTIONS.md` section 14.2).

## 1. Status labels

| Label | Meaning in this roadmap |
|---|---|
| VALIDATED | Code exists, compiles warning-free with clang++ and g++, tests exist and were run and pass |
| PROTOTYPE | Code exists and works for a narrow case; API or behaviour may still change |
| INCOMPLETE | Code or deliverables exist with known missing parts, listed next to the label |
| UNVERIFIED | Code exists but cannot be compiled or run in this environment (Unreal-facing files) |
| PLANNED | Nothing exists yet |

A task is VALIDATED only if its tests were actually run (master prompt: no fake "done").

## 2. Exit criteria for a phase

A phase is closed, and may be used as a foundation by the next one, when all of the
following hold:

1. All tests are green on the CI matrix defined in `.github/workflows/kernel-ci.yml`
   and `CMakePresets.json`: Linux clang and gcc in Debug, RelWithDebInfo and
   RelWithDebInfo without assertions, clang-format, Windows MSVC Debug, macOS AppleClang
   Debug, including the `Kernel.Purity` and `Kernel.PuritySelfTest` entries.
2. Determinism tests exist and pass for every system of the phase: same seed and same
   inputs give identical results; state round-trips through save and restore; frozen
   values guard anything that feeds the save format.
3. No file in the modules of the phase carries `STATUS: INCOMPLETE`. PROTOTYPE files
   are allowed only if the closing report lists them with their limits. Engine-facing
   files may stay UNVERIFIED until an engine-backed runner exists, and the report says so.
4. The test categories required by the master prompt are present for every important
   system: unit, integration, deterministic, edge-case and long-duration (the last one
   from the first phase that has a simulation loop, Phase 01).
5. `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `Docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `Docs/DECISIONS.md` and this file are
   updated, every architecture decision of the phase has an ADR, and the closing progress
   report shows the BUILD STATUS block with the exact commands and results.

Changing a closed phase's public API afterwards requires an ADR and, when a persisted
layout changes, a `VAELEN_SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION` bump (`Version.h`).

## 3. The 20 phases

| Phase | Name | Objective (one line) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 | FOUNDATION | Engine-agnostic kernel skeleton with dual build, core primitives (types, ids, hashing, random streams, logging, assertions, versions), base interfaces limited to `ILogSink` and `AssertHandler` (system/archive interfaces deferred to Phase 01, section 4), test harness, purity check, CI and documentation. | VALIDATED headless (00.01-00.05); engine build UNVERIFIED |
| 01 | CORE SIMULATION | Entities, components, systems and a deterministic tick scheduler; simulation clock and calendar; event bus and event log; snapshot interfaces; deterministic replay; simulation LOD 0-4 hooks. | IN PROGRESS (01.01-01.07 VALIDATED headless; 01.08 PLANNED) |
| 02 | WORLD | Procedural world of AELVOR derived from the seed: regions, tiles, terrain, climate, hydrology, resource deposits. | PLANNED |
| 03 | HISTORY | Simulated pre-history that everything later inherits: eras, cultures, languages, religions, migrations, the historical record. | PLANNED |
| 04 | POPULATION | Persons and families: birth, ageing, death, lineage, needs, demographics. | PLANNED |
| 05 | SOCIETY | Organisations, social structure, status, bondage and slavery as institutions, norms. | PLANNED |
| 06 | ECONOMY | Items, production, markets, prices, trade, wealth and its transmission. | PLANNED |
| 07 | POLITICS | Polities, laws, authority, succession, factions, diplomacy. | PLANNED |
| 08 | MILITARY | Armies, conflicts, wars, security forces, conquest and its consequences. | PLANNED |
| 09 | INFRASTRUCTURE | Buildings, settlements, routes, logistics and their decay. | PLANNED |
| 10 | PLAYER | The player as one simulated person: enslaved start, body, needs, skills, relationships; player intent as commands into the simulation. | PLANNED |
| 11 | MINING COLONY | The starting place: a huge autonomous mining colony simulated by the same systems at full detail. | PLANNED |
| 12 | GAMEPLAY | Interaction verbs, knowledge (documents, maps), reputation and consequences without main quest or canonical ending. | PLANNED |
| 13 | PRESENTATION | Unreal rendering, animation and audio of the world state, strictly read-only. | PLANNED |
| 14 | UI | Interface and read-only views; command submission through the gameplay layer. | PLANNED |
| 15 | STREAMING & LOD | Engine streaming coupled to simulation LOD 0-4: what is simulated at which detail away from the player. | PLANNED |
| 16 | SAVE/PERSISTENCE | Save format, serialisation of the whole world state, checkpoints on disk, migrations keyed on the save-format version. | PLANNED |
| 17 | DEBUG TOOLS | Inspectors, replay tooling, determinism diff, world statistics, headless console. | PLANNED |
| 18 | STRESS TEST | Long-duration and large-world runs, performance budgets, determinism at scale. | PLANNED |
| 19 | MODDING | Data-driven definitions, mod loading, stable ids and APIs for mods. | PLANNED |
| 20 | POLISH | Balance, content, quality, release readiness. | PLANNED |

Planned module names per phase are listed in `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3.2.
`IdKind` in `Ids.h` already reserves value ranges for Phases 01-12 (see ADR-0004).

## 4. Phase 00 - FOUNDATION: task breakdown and real status

Status below was established by reading the code and the tests in `Tests/Core` and by
running them (section 8). Test counts are from `VaelenCoreTests --list`. This numbering
is canonical: `Docs/STATUS.md` and commit subjects (`<phase>.<task>: ...`) use it.

Master prompt scope item "interfaces de base": Phase 00 delivers only the two interfaces
the foundation itself needs, `ILogSink` (`Log.h`) and the `AssertHandler` function
pointer (`Assert.h`). `ISystem`/`TickContext`, `IArchive`/snapshot and the command
interface are deliberately deferred to 01.03, 01.06 and Phase 10, because their shape
depends on the entity/component model that Phase 01 introduces. This scope change is
recorded here so that it stays visible.

### 00.01 Project architecture - VALIDATED (headless) / UNVERIFIED (engine)

Deliverables present:

- Unreal project: `Vaelen.uproject` (UE 5.6; modules `VaelenCore` PreDefault, `Vaelen`
  Default; plugins EnhancedInput, ModelingToolsEditorMode), `Source/Vaelen.Target.cs`,
  `Source/VaelenEditor.Target.cs`, `Source/VaelenCore/VaelenCore.Build.cs`
  (export/assert/log-floor definitions from the target configuration),
  `Source/Vaelen/Vaelen.Build.cs`, `Config/Default{Engine,Game,Editor,Input}.ini`.
- Engine bridge module `Source/Vaelen`: `FVaelenModule` installs `FVaelenLogSink`
  (kernel records to `UE_LOG`, UTF-8), the kernel assertion handler (per-site ensure
  dedupe) and aligns the kernel log floor with `LogVaelen`.
- Headless build: `/CMakeLists.txt` (options, warning set, `-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
  -ffp-contract=off`, MSVC equivalents), `Source/VaelenCore/CMakeLists.txt` (explicit
  source list), `Tests/CMakeLists.txt`, `Tests/Core/CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`
  (schema 5, CMake >= 3.24; six Linux presets, macOS, Windows).
- CI: `.github/workflows/kernel-ci.yml` (Linux clang/gcc x Debug/RelWithDebInfo/
  no-asserts, clang-format 18, Windows MSVC, macOS `macos-15`; least-privilege token,
  concurrency cancellation, timeouts).
- Style and repository hygiene: `.clang-format` (reproduces the code, checked in CI),
  `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` (LF), `.gitignore`.
- Layering and module plan: `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` sections 1-4.

Verified: headless configure, build and `ctest` for all six Linux presets (section 8),
and the full GitHub CI matrix including Windows MSVC and macOS AppleClang (run 5, all
9 jobs green). Not verified: any UBT build; every engine-facing file is labelled
UNVERIFIED and has never been compiled in this repository.

### 00.02 Core primitives: ids, hash, random - VALIDATED

| Piece | Files | Tests (suite: count) |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed-width types (`long long` 64-bit aliases matching Unreal), export macro, endianness and IEEE-754 asserts, helpers | `CoreTypes.h` | CoreTypes: 1 (+ compile-time asserts); every suite indirectly |
| Versions | `Version.h`, `Version.cpp` | Version: 7 |
| Hashing (FNV-1a 64, `Mix64`, `HashCombine`, `_vhash`) | `Hash.h` | Hash: 15 |
| Random streams (xoshiro256**, SplitMix64, `Derive`/`Fork`, `Jump`, draws; zero-state sanitising; fp-contract pragmas) | `Random.h`, `Random.cpp` | Random: 29 |
| Persistent ids and allocator (never-reused serials, corrupt-state clamping, `GetTypeHash`) | `Ids.h`, `Ids.cpp` | Ids: 19 |

All headers carry `STATUS: VALIDATED (Phase 00)` with the note that integration and
long-duration tests are deferred to Phase 01. Tests include known answers against
independent reference implementations, frozen regression values for `HashCombine` and for
`Derive`/`Fork` seeds, determinism and state round trips, edge cases (full 64-bit ranges,
serial exhaustion, all-zero state, rounding at large magnitudes) and assertion paths.
Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0004, ADR-0007, ADR-0009.

### 00.03 Logging and assertions - VALIDATED

| Piece | Files | Tests (suite: count) |
|---|---|---|
| Categories (atomic thresholds), levels, literal-only macros, sinks (recursive lock, snapshot dispatch), compile-time floor | `Log.h`, `Log.cpp` | Log: 23 (8-thread serialisation and re-entrancy tests), LogFloor: 1 |
| `VAELEN_CHECK/CHECKF/VERIFY/ENSURE/UNREACHABLE`, pluggable handler installed as one unit, failure counter, stderr + log default handler, `std::abort` | `Assert.h`, `Assert.cpp` | Assert: 33 with assertions enabled, 23 with them disabled |

Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005.

### 00.04 Test harness and purity - VALIDATED

- Harness `Tests/Harness/VaelenTest.h` (mathematically correct integer comparisons,
  negative self-test), runner `Tests/Harness/TestMain.cpp` (registry check: suite name
  must match the file, `--shuffle`, `--reverse`, zero-check warning), self-test
  `Tests/Core/Test_Harness.cpp` (Harness: 5). One CTest entry per `Test_<Suite>.cpp`
  plus `Core.Registry`, `Core.Shuffled`, `Core.Reversed`; 300 s timeouts.
- Purity checker `Tools/check_kernel_purity.py` (rules R0-R7 on headers and sources,
  exemptions, BOM/CRLF-safe, rejects symlinks, path-component module names and empty
  modules; `--self-test`: 36 checks, 0 failed), module list `Tools/kernel_modules.txt`,
  CTest entries `Kernel.Purity` (12 files, 0 violations) and `Kernel.PuritySelfTest`.

Decisions: ADR-0006, ADR-0008.

### 00.05 Foundation validation and docs - VALIDATED (headless)

Done:

- Adversarial review of the whole repository by eight independent lenses (kernel
  correctness, determinism/portability, Unreal integration, test quality, build/CI,
  documentation accuracy, master-prompt compliance, robustness/security): 189 findings,
  triaged and applied in commit `7d41751` (kernel: export macro owned by the kernel,
  Unreal-compatible 64-bit types, assertion policy from the target configuration,
  re-entrant logging, zero-state and corrupt-counter handling, fp-contract pragmas;
  harness, tests, build, CI, tools and the Unreal bridge as listed in that commit).
- `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `Docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `Docs/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-0001 to
  ADR-0009), `Docs/STATUS.md`, `README.md` and this roadmap, refreshed against the final
  code.

Deliberately not applied (see `Docs/STATUS.md`, "Discrepancies"): `FPSemantics` in the
module rules, SHA-pinned GitHub Actions, trimming the `IdKind` placeholders.

Phase 00 against the exit criteria of section 2: (1) green on the whole CI matrix
(run 5: six Linux presets, clang-format, Windows MSVC, macOS); (2) met for Random, Ids, Hash, including
frozen derivation values; (3) met: no INCOMPLETE file exists, engine files are
UNVERIFIED; (4) unit, deterministic and edge-case present; integration and long-duration
deferred to Phase 01 and stated in every STATUS line; (5) docs present, closing report in
`Docs/STATUS.md`. Verdict: **Phase 00 VALIDATED on the headless side, UNVERIFIED on the
engine side until the first UE 5.6 build.**

## 5. Phase 01 - CORE SIMULATION: task breakdown (PLANNED)

Module `VaelenSim` (kernel) exists since 01.01; tasks 01.02-01.08 are PLANNED. Directory
`Source/VaelenSim` with `Public/Vaelen/Sim/`, listed in `Tools/kernel_modules.txt`,
`/CMakeLists.txt`, `Vaelen.uproject` and both targets (`Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3.3,
rule 6). Tests in `Tests/Sim/Test_<Suite>.cpp` building `VaelenSimTests`. Each task ends
VALIDATED only with unit, deterministic and edge-case tests on both compilers; 01.07 and
01.08 supply the integration and long-duration categories for the whole phase. Every
design choice below that survives implementation gets an ADR (planned numbers 0010+).

### 01.01 Entity handles and registry - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered: `EntityHandle` (64-bit: 32-bit generation, 32-bit slot index; null is
  value 0, live generations start at 1) and `EntityRegistry` (`Create(PersistentId)`,
  `Create(IdAllocator&, IdKind)`, `Destroy`, `IsAlive`, `GetId`, `Find`, `ForEachAlive`
  in slot order, `GetState`/`SetState` with full consistency validation, `Clear`).
  Slots are recycled through a LIFO free list; a slot whose generation reaches
  `MaxGeneration` is retired. The `PersistentId` lookup is an `unordered_map` used for
  lookups only. Module `VaelenSim` with its own `VAELEN_SIM_API`, listed in
  `Tools/kernel_modules.txt`, `/CMakeLists.txt`, `Vaelen.uproject` and both targets.
- Tests (`Tests/Sim`): EntityHandle 3, EntityRegistry 13: dense allocation, LIFO reuse
  with generation bump, stale/null/out-of-range handles, slot-order iteration,
  determinism across instances, state round trip, rejection of inconsistent states,
  retirement at the last generation, one million create/destroy cycles, assertion paths.
- Decision: ADR-0010. Engine side (`VaelenSim.Build.cs`, `VaelenSimModule.cpp`)
  UNVERIFIED.

### 01.02 Component storage - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered: `ComponentTypeRegistry` (explicit, ordered registration of trivially
  copyable types under unique names; ids are registration indices, name hashes the
  stable identity; `LayoutDigest` for snapshot compatibility), `ComponentType<T>` (typed
  id, no RTTI), `ComponentPool<T>` (sparse set: dense data + dense full handles + sparse
  index by slot; `Add/Get/TryGet/Has/Remove`, swap-with-last removal, `ForEach`, validated
  `GetState`/`SetState`; stale generations never match and are replaced with a report),
  `ComponentStore` (one pool per created type, typed lookup, `RemoveAll` in id order).
- Tests (`Tests/Sim`): ComponentType 4, ComponentPool 8, ComponentStore 3: ordered ids,
  lookup and digest, add/get/remove, swap-remove consistency, stale handles, iteration,
  state round trip and rejection, determinism across instances, one million operations
  against a live registry, misuse paths.
- Decision: ADR-0011. Dense order is a function of the operation sequence, not slot
  order; systems needing a canonical order iterate the registry or sort by id.

### 01.03 Systems and tick scheduler - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered (`System.h`, `Scheduler.cpp`): `ISystem` (stable name, dependencies by
  name, `SimLod` 0-4, `Tick(TickContext&)`), `TickContext` (tick, clock, registry,
  component store, the system's own stream, event bus slot for 01.05), `LodSchedule`
  (periods 1, 4, 24, 720, 8640 ticks by default), `Scheduler` (`Add/Remove/Build/
  RunTick`): Kahn's algorithm with a name-hash tie-break, so the execution order is a
  pure function of the set of systems; unknown dependencies, cycles (self included),
  duplicate names and invalid LOD schedules are reported and refuse to run. Each system
  receives `WorldStream.Derive(name).Fork(tick)` every tick: its draws depend on the
  world seed, its own name and the tick only. `RunTick` advances the clock.
- Tests (`Tests/Sim/Test_Scheduler.cpp`, 8): order independent of registration order,
  hash-ordered independent systems, error reporting, LOD tick counts over two years,
  stream independence from other systems and equality with the documented derivation,
  dependency-ordered execution log, identical evolution of two worlds with the same seed
  (and divergence with another), misuse paths.
- Decision: ADR-0012.

### 01.04 Simulation clock and calendar - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered (`SimClock.h`, header-only, constexpr): `SimTick` (`uint64`),
  `CalendarRules` (data: ticks per hour, hours per day, days per month, months per year,
  months per season; defaults 1/24/30/12/3, i.e. a 360-day AELVOR year of four seasons),
  `Calendar::ToDate/ToTick` (pure inverses over the whole `uint64` range), `SimClock`
  (`Now`, `Advance` by exactly one tick, `Restore` for snapshots, `Date`).
- Tests (`Tests/Sim/Test_SimClock.cpp`, 4): boundaries (last tick of a year, first of
  the next, season edges), round trips on samples up to `MaxTick` and exhaustively over
  two years, custom rules and validation, clock advance/restore, constexpr evaluation.
- Decision: ADR-0013. Irregular calendars (leap days) remain a data decision for Phase
  02/03; `CalendarRules` is the extension point.

### 01.05 Event bus and event log - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered: `Event` (`Event.h`: 112-byte plain record with id of kind Event, tick,
  type hash, cause id, subject id and up to 64 payload bytes; every byte defined, so
  events hash and serialise as raw bytes; `EventType<T>` / `MakeEventType`), `EventLog`
  (`EventBus.h/.cpp`: append-only, running digest, byte image with count and digest,
  corruption rejected, `CountCausedBy`), `EventBus` (publish at a tick with subject and
  cause, next-tick delivery in publish order, listeners per type ordered by listener
  name hash, events published during dispatch deferred to the next tick, ids from the
  world allocator, every publication logged). `Scheduler::RunTick` dispatches the
  pending events before running the systems of a tick.
- Tests (`Tests/Sim`, 10): payload round trip and zero-filled bytes, hash coverage,
  append-only digest (order-sensitive), byte round trip and corruption detection,
  next-tick delivery order across ticks, type filtering and listener order independent
  of subscription order, deferral during dispatch with causal link, no subscribers /
  empty payload, scheduler integration with a birth -> death causal chain and equal
  digests for two identical worlds, misuse paths.
- Decision: ADR-0014.

### 01.06 Persistence interfaces and snapshot - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered: `World` (`World.h/.cpp`: owns every state block - id allocator, root
  random stream, clock, entity registry, component store, pending events, event log -
  and references the code that acts on it: type registrations, systems, listeners;
  `Build`, `Tick`, `TickMany`, `CreateEntity`, `DestroyEntity`), `IArchive` with
  `MemoryWriter` / `MemoryReader` (`Archive.h/.cpp`: one symmetric `Serialize` per type,
  no exceptions, a read past the end sets a sticky error and zero-fills, vector counts
  bounded), `SaveSnapshot` / `LoadSnapshot` / `ComputeStateDigest` (`Snapshot.h/.cpp`:
  header with magic, `VAELEN_SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION`, component layout digest and seed;
  clock, root stream, 256 id counters, entity slots written field by field, pools in
  type-id order with type id, name hash and element size, pending events, event log;
  FNV-1a trailer digest checked before any state changes; every rejection is an explicit
  `SnapshotResult`). The plain-data rule (`PlainData.h`): component and payload types
  must have a unique object representation (no padding), proven by the compiler for
  integer types and declared through `PlainDataTraits<T>` for floating-point members.
  `IComponentPool::Serialize` / `ElementSize` and `EventBus::GetPending` / `SetPending`
  expose the remaining state.
- Not in this task: the streams derived per system per tick are recomputed from the
  root seed and the tick (ADR-0012), so only the root stream state is saved; on-disk
  files, compression and migration between format versions come in Phase 16.
- Tests (`Tests/Sim`, 15): archive scalar/vector round trip, bounds error with
  zero-fill and sticky failure, count limit, empty writes; world build/tick/lifecycle,
  identical worlds give identical state digests (seed, entity count and tick each
  change it), tick before build reported; snapshot round trip of every block (including
  a destroyed entity and undelivered events), restored world continues exactly like the
  uninterrupted run (state digest, log digest and count after 300 ticks), byte-identical
  images for identical worlds, empty world, wrong version, bad magic, truncation before
  and inside the body, flipped bytes at five offsets, trailing bytes, different seed,
  different component layout, missing pool, 50 000-entity world.
- Decision: ADR-0015.

### 01.07 Deterministic replay test - VALIDATED (headless)

- Delivered: `Tests/Sim/Test_Replay.cpp`, the phase's deterministic and integration
  gate. A replay world with three systems at three LOD levels (Population every tick,
  Harvest daily with a famine path, Migration monthly founding and abandoning
  settlements, so entities are created and destroyed mid-run), a listener that turns
  every famine into a decree next tick (causal chain through the bus), and a recorded
  external input stream (found / raid / decree at given ticks, generated from a script
  seed). The reference run is 2000 ticks (83 days, so daily and monthly systems both
  fire many times).
- Tests (5): seed + inputs replayed in a fresh world give the identical event log
  (event by event), state digest and snapshot image; checkpoint at ticks 0, 1, 37, 720,
  721 and 1999, restore into a fresh world, run to 2000: state and log digests equal
  the uninterrupted run; eight chained generations of restore (every 250 ticks, each
  from the previous checkpoint) equal the uninterrupted run; any change (seed, tick
  count, one input value, one input tick, one dropped input) diverges in state and log;
  frozen reference values (state `dbb98f0004e8cd91`, log `2c1e775e47e45051`, 11 229
  events, 199 live entities) that every compiler and platform in CI must reproduce -
  clang 18 and gcc 13 do; Windows MSVC and macOS AppleClang are checked by the GitHub
  workflow on every push.
- Decision: the cross-compiler comparison is done with frozen constants inside the test
  rather than a CTest script diffing two binaries: it also covers MSVC and AppleClang,
  which never share a build directory with the Linux compilers, and a change of the
  simulation's observable behaviour becomes a deliberate edit of the constants.
- Rule confirmed by this task (ADR-0015 rule 6): systems hold no state of their own;
  the first version of the snapshot test kept a "born" list inside a system and could
  not continue identically after a restore.

### 01.08 Abstract mini-world end-to-end test

- Goal: exercise every Phase 01 piece together over a long run, without any AELVOR
  content.
- Planned: a toy world with three or four systems (a population counter, a resource
  pool, a random event producer, an LOD-sensitive system), run for a long duration
  (order of 100,000 ticks) with periodic snapshots and replays; invariants checked every
  N ticks; a performance baseline logged, not asserted.
- Tests: this task is a test suite (`Test_MiniWorld.cpp`); it is the phase's
  long-duration gate.
- Exit: VALIDATED; Phase 01 closed against section 2.

## 6. Phases 02-20: notes

No task breakdown exists yet for Phases 02-20; each is broken down when the previous
phase closes. Fixed points already in the code: `IdKind` values for Region, Tile, River,
ResourceDeposit (Phase 02), Culture, Language, Religion, Person, Family, Organization
(Phases 03-05), Item, Building, Settlement, Market, Route (Phases 06, 09), Polity, Law,
Army, War (Phases 07-08), Document, Map (Phase 12); `VAELEN_SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION`
(Phase 16); `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` and `DefaultInput.ini` note that the game engine
class and Enhanced Input mappings arrive in Phase 10.
